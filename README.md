# Refactoring-SEO

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.
